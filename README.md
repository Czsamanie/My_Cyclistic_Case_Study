# My_Cyclistic_Case_Study
INTRODUCTION

This capstone project is the final project of my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. In this case study I will be analyzing a public dataset for a fictional company –Cyclistic, provided by the course.

To analyze this data, I will be using the R programming language because the data is quite large, as we’ll be dealing with 12 months data, and it’s a great option for statistical analysis tools and data visualizations.

The following data analysis steps will be followed:
Ask

Prepare

Process

Analyze
