CASE SCENARIO

In this case scenario, it is assumed that I’m a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company in Chicago.

Cyclistic’s director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on taking advantage and maximizing the number of annual memberships.

Therefore, the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

If we can find how these two categories of people use bike differently, then we can design a new marketing design that helps convert casual riders into annual members.
